# NextGram with modal and page transitions

This is a fork of the sample Next.js application that takes advantage of the advanced routing capabilities, sprinkled with animations using `framer-motion`.

The photo route can be attached to _two distinct_ components:

1. When navigating within the application, it is rendered as a modal
1. When the page is refreshed, it is rendered as a standalone page
